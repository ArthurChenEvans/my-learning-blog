        <h1>Who am I? What is this site?</h1>
        <p>This site is essentially just a way for me to keep track of what I've learned regarding web design and development,
            as well as a platform to help me reteach it in my own words so that I can improve my understanding.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to define a rule when reading this site. Whenever you see a <b>new and important idea</b> like this, then it will be bolded. When I am repeating said <i>new and important idea</i>
            I will italicize it to show I have already brought it up and to help keep your focus on the fact it is still an important 'thing'.
            However, whenever I move onto a new topic or section, this styling gets reset. That means that whatever was bolded and italicized prior will no longer have those special
            styling. The reason for this is to stop noise clutter as well as to draw focus to the current subject at hand.</i></p>
