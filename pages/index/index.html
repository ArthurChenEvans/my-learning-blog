        <h1>Who am I? What is this site?</h1>
        <p>This site tracks my web development learning journey and helps me reinforce concepts by teaching them in my
            own words.</p>

        <p>I'd also like to define a rule when reading this site. Whenever you see a <b>new and important idea</b> like
            this, then it will be bolded. When I am repeating said <i>new and important idea,</i>
            I will italicize it to show I have already brought it up and to help keep your focus on the fact it is still
            an important 'thing.'
            However, whenever I move onto a new topic or section, this styling gets reset. That means that whatever was
            bolded and italicized prior will no longer have those special
            styling. The reason for this is to stop noise clutter as well as to draw focus to the current subject at
            hand.</p>

        <p>Additionally, anything noted with a <b>'*'</b> right after it means I will give a definition for it at the bottom of the page.</p>
