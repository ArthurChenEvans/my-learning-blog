            <h1>Flexbox Basics</h1>
            <p>A <b>flexbox</b> is simply a type of container that allows for more granular position of its child items using an x/y-axis for alignment. On top of
                item alignment, it also takes care of spacing, gaps, item size distribution based on available space, and how items wrap around based on available space.
            <br><br>
                Take for instance the following:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="code_block">
<span class="css_selector">.container</span> {
    <span class="css_property">display</span>: flex;
    <span class="css_property">justify-content</span>: center;
    <span class="css_property">align-items</span>: center;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>The above sets up a normal box as a <i>flexbox</i>. The other two properties define how the items inside the box are aligned between two axes: <b>main</b> and <b>cross</b>, with <code>justify-content</code> handling the <i>main-axis</i> and <code>align-items</code> handling the <i>cross-axis</i>.
                <br><br>
                So, what is the <i>main-axis</i> and the <i>cross-axis</i>? The <i>main-axis</i> is the line that runs parallel to the flexbox's main direction, which there are two of: <b>row</b> and <b>column</b>. By default, <i>row</i> is the direction of the flexbox.
                In this case, the <i>main-axis</i> is the <b>x-axis</b>. So then, what is the <i>cross-axis</i>? It's the one that "crosses" the <i>main-axis</i>, or in other words, runs perpendicular to the flexbox's direction of flow. Using <i>row</i>'s case again,
                this would mean the <i>cross-axis</i> is the <b>y-axis</b>. What do you think happens when we set the <code>flex-direction</code> property to <i>column</i>? If you guessed that the <i>main-axis</i> and <i>cross-axis</i> gets flipped, then you are correct!
                Remember, the <i>main-axis</i> will run parallel to the direction of the flexbox's flow, and the <i>cross-axis</i> will run perpendicular to it.

            <h1>Flex Flow</h1>
            <p>As stated prior, we can define the <i>main</i> and <i>cross</i> axes flow using the <code>flex-direction</code> property. From there, you can use <code>justify-content</code> to define how items are positioned along the <i>main-axis</i> and <code>align-items</code> for item positioning along the <i>cross-axis</i>.
            For specific values for these properties you can check the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">css tricks website here</a>.</p>
            <p>With the above being understood, you can now use another handy property that directs how items flow onto the next line (or not!). This is called the <b>wrapping</b> of a flexbox and uses the property <code>flex-wrap</code> to manage it. It's really simple as all it does to define whether items will resize themselves
             to fit on a line via <code>flex-wrap: nowrap</code> or will keep their size and move onto the next line via <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is another property to introduce for this section. However, this property doesn't do anything new but merges two properties we have already talked about together. This property is called <code>flex-flow</code> and
            takes two values: <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-flow</code>. Essentially, put in the values you'd usually put for those two properties into <code>flex-fow</code> in that stated order. For example:</p>
            <pre><code class="code_block">
<span class="css_selector">.container</span> {
    <span class="css_property">flex-flow</span>: row wrap;
}
            </code></pre>
