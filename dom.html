            <h1>The Basics</h1>
            <p>Firstly, to understand what exactly <b>DOM manipulation</b> means, I'll have to unabbreviate "DOM",
            which is the <b>Document Object Model</b>. What is the DOM? It's an interactable JavaScript object that acts as an API
            for us to fiddle with the HTML elements and their attributes without directly editing the HTML file itself.
            </p>
            <p>One of the simplest ways to do that is via querying the <code>document</code> object and editing the <code>classList</code>. The <code>classList</code>
                is a property of a queried element that allows direct access to its <code>class=""</code> attribute like so:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="code_block">
<span class="js_keyword">const</span> heading = document.<span class="js_function">querySelector</span>(<span class="js_string">'h1'</span>);
heading.classList.<span class="js_function">remove</span>(<span class="js_string">'old_class'</span>);
heading.classList.<span class="js_function">add</span>(<span class="js_string">'new_class'</span>);

<span class="js_comment">// Below will disable/enable class based on current state</span>
heading.classList.<span class="js_function">toggle</span>(<span class="js_string">'new_class'</span>);
            </code></pre>
            <p>On top of this, there is also <b>event listening</b>. <i>Events</i> in JavaScript are listeners for specific actions such as pressing a key or clicking a button.
            When the <i>event</i> of clicking a button is detected the element associated with that event gets fired and performs any additional functionalities. For example:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="code_block">
<span class="js_keyword">const</span> button = document.<span class="js_function">querySelector</span>(<span class="js_string">'.modal-button'</span>);
button.<span class="js_function">addEventListener</span>(<span class="js_string">'click'</span>, () => {
    openModal();
};
            </code></pre>
            <p>In the above example I have selected a button with a class of <code>modal-button</code>. From there,
            I have added an event listener that listens to a click event, and once it is detected, the function that handles
            opening up a modal is called.</p>
            <h1>The DOM API Hierarchy</h1>
            <p>Fundamentally, most objects in the DOM API are a <b>node</b>. To be more precise, they all have <i>node</i> as a parent. So what is a <i>node?</i>
            It's a representation of whatever is on an HTML document, with <code>Element</code>, <code>Comment</code>, <code>Text</code>, and <code>Document</code>
            all being represented with a <code>Node</code> parent. A single HTML file typically has all of these various <i>nodes</i> under the file's main <code>NodeList</code>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, <i>nodes</i> share a sibling object which is known as the <b>window</b> object. This handles global properties and functions that deal with the browser's
            window itself. Lastly, both the <i>node</i> and <i>window</i> object can have an even higher parent if there is an event attached to them. This parent is the
            <code>EventTarget</code>. Recall the example event listener we made earlier. See where the <code>() => { }</code> part of the code is? Typically, we can pass <code>e</code> as a paremeter
            to the function, where <code>e</code> represents an event. You can then access the <code>EventTarget</code> property of the event via <code>e.target</code>. The importance of this
            will be explained later, but for now I wanted you to be aware of it.</p>
